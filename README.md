#Project 1 Photography Website

My first idea is a photography website for Tanna Marie Photography. This was a project I first thought of even before joining the Iron Yard. It would be a site for a high school friend who has her own business. Most of the users would be parents of students, newlyweds, new parents with newborns or babies on the way.

The user will be greeted with a landing page and then taken to a home page with a collage of pictures. From there they can choose to look at different styles of photos from wedding, senior pictures or portraits. Each of these pages will have different files of work that show the photographers skills. There will be a page that the user will be able to contact her and also submit a request to schedule specific dates. The site will have links to other various social media accounts.


#Project 2  Meal Prep App Best Idea - might be a little larger

The user will login to their own account and then be taken to a page with a nav bar on the top. The nav ar will be split into 4 sections (Recipes(High Priority,High Impact) , My Recipes(Medium Priority, High Impact), Calendar(High Priority, High Impact,), Goals(Low Priority,Low Impact)). The recipes page will allow the user to search for different recipes based on a specific search. The my recipes tab will be a page where they save recipes that they like. The calendar page will allow the user to plan out their meals for each meal throughout the week. The goals will be a list of things the user wants to accomplish while on their diet.  


# For both

I would lay my project out and divide the different sections out by three day increments. I would first research what kind of sites already exist, design my site, research other functionalities if needed, create a mock up in XD, then code actual site. My strongest points would be in the designing of the site. I believe that part would be easiest. The weakest points for me would be adding the functionality to certain parts with javascript. It would take me a bit longer if I need to research how to do some of it.
